					Cars and Coffee North East's next event takes place on Sunday the 5th of January 2020 between 9.30am and 1pm in the carpark of the old Carroll's factory at DKIT Dundalk (Entrance beside the Crowne Plaza Hotel).<br>
					Our December show had a fabulous turnout of cars including several <i>'Supercars'</i> from the Driven Club in Belfast.<br> Along with a great turnout of cars we were also lucky yet again to have another brilliant Sunny Dry Day. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We wish to thank everyone who helped make 2019 a brilliant year for our events and we can't wait to see what wonderful machines turn up in January and the rest of 2020. 		
				</p>

				<p>
					Please note we now have three car parking areas, Car Park 1 & 2 are for Show Cars only and Car Park 3 is for Spectator Parking.<br>
					We look forward to seeing you all again for a chat and of course some great coffee too.<br>
					Please note Toilets are available in the Crowne Plaza Hotel which is a 4 minute walk from where we hold the car show.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					As ever a €2 donation per car to offset the costs of running the event would be greatly appreciated.
				</p>
				<p>We look forward to seeing you all again and until then we wish you 
					A Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year 
					from all at Cars and Coffee North East.
